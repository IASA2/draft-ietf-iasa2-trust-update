      <t>This memo updates the process for selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight 
      Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees, but the IAOC 
      has been eliminated as part of an update of the structure of 
      the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo 
      specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately.</t>

      <t>This memo obsoletes RFC 4371. The changes relate only to the
      selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
      remain as they are today.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This memo updates the process for selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight 
      Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees, but the IAOC 
      has been eliminated as part of an update of the structure of 
      the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo 
      specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately. See
      <xref target="selection"/>.</t>    

      <t>This memo obsoletes RFC 4371. The changes relate only to the
      selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
      remain as they are today. <xref target="trust"/> copies the
      definition as it was in RFC 4371, only leaving out the part about
      trustee selection and adding a reference to the IETF Trust website.</t>
      
      <t>For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale
      for these specific changes, see <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-rationale"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="trust" title="IETF Trust">

      <t>A Trust ("the IETF Trust") has been formed for the purpose of
      acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing and
      future intellectual property and other property used in connection
      with the administration of the IETF.  The Trust was formed by the
      signatures of its Settlors and initial Trustees.  The Settlors, who
      contributed initial intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and
      the Corporation for National Research Initiatives.  The Beneficiary of
      the IETF Trust is the IETF as a whole.</t>

      <t>Further details of the IETF Trust may be found at the IETF
      Trust's website, <eref target="https://trustee.ietf.org/"/>.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="selection" title="Selection of Trustees">
      
      <t>This document revises the original Trustee selection procedures
      defined in <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref target="RFC4371"/>, 
      to eliminate the requirement that trustees be drawn from the 
      members of the IAOC.</t>  
	    
      <t>In this newly revised IETF Trust structure, there will be
      five Trustees.  Three shall be appointed by the IETF Nominating
      Committee (NomCom) and confirmed by the Internet Engineering
      Steering Group (IESG), one shall be appointed by the IESG, and
      one shall be appointed by the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of
      Trustees. The appointments by the IESG and ISOC Board of
      Trustees do not require confirmation.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust Chair informs the nominating committee
      of the Trustee positions to be reviewed. The IETF Trust will
      provide a summary of the expertise desired of the Trustee
      candidates to each appointing body.</t>
      
      <t>A change to the Trust Agreement is required to put this
      change into effect, and this document requests that the current
      Trustees make this change at the earliest convenient time and no
      later than the end of the 104th IETF meeting in March 2019.</t>
      
      <t>The terms of the appointed trustees from IETF NomCom shall be
      three years.  The initial selection shall be one, two, and three
      year terms in order to initially stagger the terms. The other
      appointments by the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees shall be
      two year terms, with the initial terms being one and two years,
      respectively.

      The goal of the staggered initial terms is to minimize potential
      Trustee turnover in any single year. To maintain the
      staggered terms, each appointing body may at its discretion
      appoint Trustees for shorter terms as needed in exceptional
      situations, e.g., for mid-term vacancies or when an appointment
      is not ready by the time of the first IETF of the year.</t>

      <t>Once the initial trustee selections according to the
      procedures in this document are complete, and at each subsequent
      annual meeting of the IETF Trust once new trustees are seated,
      the trustees shall elect by a majority vote of the IETF Trust
      one trustee to serve as IETF Trust Chair.</t>
      
      <t>The processes regarding NomCom appointments and recalls of
      Trustees for the IETF Trust follow those described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis"/>. For the appointments by the IESG, the
      IESG is expected to run an open selection process and to consider
      the necessary skill set and conflicts of interest as part of
      that process.</t>

    <section anchor="changes" title="Changes from Previous Versions">

      <t>RFC Editor: Please remove this section upon publication.</t>

      <t>The -03pre1b version replaced updates of RFCs 4071 and 4371
      with obsoletion of RFC 4371, and updated the reference to RFC
      7437 to its newer bis version. It also copied the one remaining
      paragraph from RFC 4371 to this document.</t>
      
      <t>The version draft-itef-iasa2-trust-update-02.txt made some
      editorial corrections, as well as clarifying that no
      confirmation is needed in the cases other than the nomcom
      appointment, specified how IETF Trust chair is chosen, and
      required that an open process be used by the IESG for the
      selections.</t>
      
      <t>The version draft-ietf-iasa2-trust-update-01.txt has taken
      into account last call comments. The changes are: 1)
      Clarification of the role of the IETF Trust Chair to
      indicate which trustee positions are up for selection, similar to how RFC
      7437 requires the IETF Executive Director to do it. 2)
      The addition of empty security and IANA consideration
      sections. 3) The clarification of the staggering rules for
      NomCom selections. 4) Updated text regarding the application of
      rules from RFC 7437. 5) Update draft title to be correct in
      terms of specifying a process rather than the actual persons.
      6) Update the text regarding desirable expertise to use the
      same language as in RFC 7437 instead of the "list of desired
      qualifications".</t>
      
      <t>The version draft-ietf-iasa2-trust-update-00.txt corrected
      the desired document status to BCP, and made several editorial
      and language updates. This version also updated the wording for
      the request for the current trustees to adopt this change, from
      "earliest convenience" to "earliest convenient time".</t>

      <t>The version draft-arkko-iasa2-trust-update-00.txt was the
      initial version.</t>
